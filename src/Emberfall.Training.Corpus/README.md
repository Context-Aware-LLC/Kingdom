# Emberfall training corpus

The training corpus keeps the server replay journal small and stable. `NetSoak dataset` writes two
raw inputs:

- `replays/<matchId>.jsonl` — seed, accepted intents, and outcome from the existing replay adapter;
- `episode-manifests.jsonl` — ordered decks plus engine, card-data, and bot-policy provenance.

Only clean terminal matches receive a manifest row. The manifest references its replay by a path
relative to the manifest file and pins the replay, card data, build revision, every accepted
intent's before/after projected-state hashes, and both players' terminal projected-state hashes.

## Capture

The output directory may be anywhere, including an external drive:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/Emberfall.Tools.NetSoak -c Release -- `
  dataset 200 "E:\EmberfallData\raw\run-001"
```

Use a new directory for each run. Match IDs and manifest rows are unique within a run, and capture
refuses to append a duplicate episode.

## Materialize

The .NET builder, rather than Python, replays through the real Emberfall core and enumerates legal
actions. Every observation is projected for the acting player before it is serialized.

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/Emberfall.Tools.TrainingCorpus -c Release -- build `
  --manifests "E:\EmberfallData\raw\run-001\episode-manifests.jsonl" `
  --cards "unity\Emberfall\Assets\CardData" `
  --out "E:\EmberfallData\corpus\v1"
```

The builder writes `decisions.jsonl`, `episodes.jsonl`, and `dataset-manifest.json` through temporary
`.partial` files. It refuses replay checksum drift, card-data or contract drift, illegal recorded
actions, terminal-state drift, and terminal-outcome disagreement. `dataset-manifest.json` contains
record counts and output checksums and is path-independent for reproducible builds.

Python tensor, analytics, and conversational exporters should consume these model-neutral rows.
They must not reimplement game rules or reconstruct hidden authority state.

## Export

The dependency-free streaming exporters validate this directory and can write all large artifacts
to an external drive. Full format, split, padding, and restart semantics are documented in
`tooling/scripts/training_exporters/README.md`.

```powershell
python -m tooling.scripts.training_exporters export-rl `
  --input "E:\EmberfallData\corpus\v1" `
  --out "E:\EmberfallData\exports\rl-v1" `
  --seed "season-001" --shard-rows 10000

python -m tooling.scripts.training_exporters export-chat `
  --input "E:\EmberfallData\corpus\v1" `
  --out "E:\EmberfallData\exports\chat-v1" `
  --seed "season-001" --shard-rows 10000
```

Decision-row `reward` and `done` describe the immediate transition. `episodeReturn` carries the
eventual `-1`/`0`/`+1` outcome from that row's actor perspective, so the winning player retains a
training signal when the opponent performs the final action (for example, concession).
